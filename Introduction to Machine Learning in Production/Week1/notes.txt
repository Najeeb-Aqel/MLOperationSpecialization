----Intro------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- ML is more than just running your experiment within a Jupyter notebook. 
- one misconsiption about ML is that after running the experiment within your notebook, you only need some software engineering skills 
for the Deployment but that is not true. 
- One of the biggest issue facing in production is that the distribution of the data that Model faces in real world can be different 
than what it was trained on, the world changes and thus your ML Model as well. Deployment as well. 


-Curriculum-
- Course1: Intro Course. Overview of the whole ML Life Cyle. 
- Course2: Data and how it evolves over time. 
- Course3: ML modeling pipeline in Production. 
- Course4: Deployment. 



----The Machine Learning Life Cycle-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome Section: 

- Edge Device: a device that lives in the factory manufacturing hardware. 
- Prediction servers can be on cloud or on the edge as well. 
- Concept Drift/ Data Drift: the problem of dealing with real world data that is differen than what you have trained on so far. 
- Success of training your model within a dev environment can take an extra work of up to 6 months to practical Deployment. (It's still a great Success but as ML Engineers we have to watch out for)
    - Some ML Team would not consider such problems as ML problems, Andrew NG doesn't agree here, he thinks that ML Team responsibility is to make things work. 
- MLCode represents 5-10% at max of the MLProject code required to get your model into Production. (POC to Production gap)
