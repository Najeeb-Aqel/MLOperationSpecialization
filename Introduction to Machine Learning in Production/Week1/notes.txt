- ML is more than just running your experiment within a Jupyter notebook. 
- one misconsiption about ML is that after running the experiment within your notebook, you only need some software engineering skills 
for the Deployment but that is not true. 
- One of the biggest issue facing in production is that the distribution of the data that Model faces in real world can be different 
than what it was trained on, the world changes and thus your ML Model as well. Deployment as well.
