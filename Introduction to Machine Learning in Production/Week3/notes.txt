----Define Data and establish baseline-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is data definition hard?
    - 


Major types of data problems:
    - Major Types of Machine Learning Projects: 
        - unstructured.
        - Structured.
        - Small Data. < 10000 samples 
        - Big Data. >= 10000 samples

Small VS Big Data: 
    Small Data: clean lavels 

Data one size fit all, doens't work here: 


Improving Labels Consistency: 
    - Have Multipel labelers label same example. 
        - Have Labelers discuss definition of y to reach agreement. 
    - If labelers believe that x doesn't contain enough information, consider changing x.

Human level performance (HLP):
    - Very Helpful for establishing baseline of what could be possible.(Helps stablish a more reasonable target)
    - Ground Truth Label: At then end you are comparing against Ground Truth established by 
    - "Prove" the ML system is superior to humans doing the job and thus bussiness should adopt it, (This logic rarely works i practice)
    

Raising HLP:2
    - Ground Truth: is basically another human label. 
        - try to figure out why HLP from the other labeler is different from the Ground Truth.


----Label and Organize Data ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining data:
     - dedicate few days to collect data (This should quickly get you into the ML iteration).
     - Inventory Process: analyze data sources and thing thourh all the tradeoffs of costs etc... to choose the best data source.
     - Don't increase data by more than 10x at a time.
     
Data pipeline(Cascades):
    - data provenance: where did the data come from. 
    - Lineage: sequence of data. 
    - Extensive Meta-data can helps reduce the complextity of data Cascades.


Balanced train/dev/test splits:
    - especially when having a small data set, being able to balnce your data, can increase your performance.
